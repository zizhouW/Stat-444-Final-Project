# Motivation and introduction of the problem
After seeing our final dataset, we raised the question of if it is possible to predict an NBA player's salary based on his previous year's performance. Our project consists of three major parts, smoothing spline, random foresets, and boosting. We used smoothing spline to model our data, by testing different models constructed by different combinations of explanatory variates, we were able to get the best model for our data on hand to predict players' salary. We used random forest to find the importance of our explanatory variates, and we were able to find the most important variates to minimize the error. We were also able to find the importance of each variable using the gradient boosting method.
